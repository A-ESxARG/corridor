# Role Construction

In both Formal and Hidden stages, roles involve the following three positions of strategy:

## Instigator

This is always a fair, transactional move on the stage board. This is never for scoring, nor win/loss but an agreement to play with no planned end.

## Observer

This is inferencing process used to decode board dynamics and signal interpretation, strictly dependent on the active lens construction.

## Receiver

This is the signal collection and acknowledgement to decide which role to perform next and when.
