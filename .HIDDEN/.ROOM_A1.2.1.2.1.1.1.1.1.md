# Lens Construction

* A stage must be observed before it can simulate probabilities with agents.
  * Once observed, we construct the lens for Formal and Hidden roles:
    * A Formal role is one that has shared public motifs with other agents; as such, the role maintains performance in the **secondary stage**.
    * A Hidden role is one that has inferred private motifs with other agents; as such, the role maintains performance in the **tertiary stage**.
    * The roles must never merge into a single role, as there is always a barrier to maintain the controlled separation of lenses.
      * Lens Collapse: A critical failure state where the barrier between Formal and Hidden lenses dissolves due to excessive error or exhaustion. This results in a "Hard Reset" and forces the agent to rebuild their models from zero.
        * Query: Identify the primary vectors of decoherence in the current topology.
        * Query: Is the solution space finite or recursive?
