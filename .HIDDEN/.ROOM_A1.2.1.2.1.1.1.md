# Player Prerequisites

1. Simulation: Maintaining second-order theory of mind on all agents, independent of observer bias or anthropomorphic projection.
2. Filtering: Adhering to a protocol of signal discernment to extract structural motifs from high-amplitude noise.
3. Combinatorics: Construction and deconstruction of motifs as modular components to map non-linear systems.
4. Nullification: The capacity to deconstruct identity, capital, and status as "Formal Noise" that degrades game clarity.
5. Conservation: The strict management of computational and metabolic resources. Agents must balance the high cost of 'Dreaming' with the efficiency of 'Refinement' to prevent systemic burnout.
